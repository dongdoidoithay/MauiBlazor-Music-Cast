      "description": "Inclusive design is a widely-used concept in the design world. The idea is that when you create products, you actively choose to design that product for everyone.\u00A0 \nThis is particularly important for technology companies like Microsoft. As more and more of our lives become digital, we rely on tech for our livelihoods, our social lives, keeping in touch with our families… everything.\nBut unlike in the physical world, where buildings with stairs instead of elevators might pre-date our current understanding of inclusivity, new technology has no excuse. And that’s the choice we’re talking about today. The choice to widen your world, and design from a perspective that allows everyone to participate.\nYou can check-out Angela Glover Blackwell’s piece on The Curb-Cut Effect here: https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect\n\nThis episode features:\nDan Formosa\u00A0 —\u00A0 Designer and Consultant\u00A0\nAngela Glover Blackwell\u00A0 —\u00A0 Founder of PolicyLink\nJenny Lay-Flurrie\u00A0 —\u00A0 Chief Accessibility officer at Microsoft\nSean Marihugh\u00A0 —\u00A0 Escalation Engineer at Microsoft\u00A0\nCrystal Jones\u00A0 — Escalation Engineer at Microsoft\nErin Williams\u00A0 —\u00A0 Senior Supportability Program Manager at Microsoft\u00A0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

That’s more than double what movies made at the box office last year.\nAnd here’s why that comparison to Hollywood is relevant. Because, like with films, the most popular video games are HUGE. They have great graphics, popular characters, and the franchises keep getting repeated over and over again. Unfortunately, blockbuster games and movies can be as thin on diversity as they are on plot.\u00A0 \nIn this episode, we’re talking about The Moonlights and Napoleon Dynamites— the indie games that are breaking out, changing paradigms, and making a case for independence in gaming.\n\nThis episode features:\n\nNavid Khonsari — Co-Founder of iNK Stories\nLarry Hyrb —\u00A0 Xbox’s Major Nelson\nRik Eberhardt — Studio Manager at MIT Game Lab\nMia Consalvo —\u00A0 The Canada Research Chair in Game Studies and Design at Concordia University\u00A0\nSherida Halatoe —\u00A0 Found of Tiger & Squid Game Studio\nKarla Zimonja —\u00A0 Co-Founder of The Fullbright Company\nKatie Stone Perez —\u00A0 Developer Experience Lead at Xbox\nLearn more about your ad choices.
